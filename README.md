# Who are the users of the software?
The users of the software would be members or administrators of a library. This library management system is a software project that mimics and improves the idea of someone checking out books at their local library. 

# What is the purpose of the software?
The purpose of this software is to mimic a library management system where the user can check out books and check the library's selection online, as well as see the books they have checked out and their library profile. This management system also includes the ability to have an admin party, that can oversee the users that are subscribed to the library, as well as add users or other admins. Like members, admins have the ability to check the library's selection, search for books within the library, and check their profile.

# Where and when will the software be used?
This software will be used in a library settings, and would used whenever an administrator needs to oversee the users, add books to their library, or search for current books within the library. A member would use this software whenever they want to check out a book, return their oldest book, check their account and see what book they've reserved, or check out the library's selection to see the next book they would want to check out.

# How does the software work?
There will be a login screen that can be used by both members and admins. However, if this member does not have an account, they have the ability to register for a new account. Once logged in, the user will be met with their dashboard, which will be different based on their user status. The dashboard contains buttona that will lead them to different pages to do the actions the user wants. 

# Why would anyone want to use the software over existing processes?
Compared to other processes, this software gives the user the ability to check out books, which in practice, would reserve their spot, so when they visit the library, they could pick up their book with no hassle. Along with that, the user can see the library even when they're not at the library, and can search for books with ease. Along with that, with all the information that is given to administrators, if a user needs to know their id or see if they're a user, the admin can check with ease.
